- **""virus"" (Word 8)**: This is a common noun (NOUN) and is the object of the preposition ""to"" (Word 6).

Together, ""corona virus"" forms a noun phrase that is the object of the prepositional phrase ""related to,"" indicating that the cause (Word 2) is related to the coronavirus. The adverb ""obviously"" (Word 4) emphasizes the certainty of this relationship.","Aspect terms identified:

3. **corona virus**: The speaker asserts that the cause is related to the coronavirus, expressing a clear opinion about the nature of the illness and critiquing the official stance.

These terms are considered aspects because they are central to the speaker's expression of opinion or criticism.","The speaker expresses a strong opinion that the cause of the pneumonia is clearly linked to the coronavirus, suggesting frustration or skepticism towards the #CCP's stance that the cause is unknown. The use of ""obviously"" emphasizes the speaker's belief that the connection should be evident.","The sentiment towards coronavirus in the given sentence is neutral. Because the speaker is not expressing a positive or negative emotion directly towards the coronavirus itself, but rather frustration or skepticism towards the #CCP's stance on the cause of pneumonia. The focus is on the perceived lack of acknowledgment by the #CCP rather than the virus itself.","The emotion towards 'coronavirus' is not directly negative or positive; however, the context suggests a mix of frustration and anticipation. The term ""obviously"" indicates a strong belief in the connection between the pneumonia and coronavirus, reflecting frustration at the denial or ignorance of this fact. Anticipation is implied by the urgency to address and acknowledge the virus's role. However, if forced to choose from the given options, the closest match would be 'anticipation' due to the eagerness for recognition and action."

24	coronavirus	coronavirus	NOUN	NN	_	22	dobj	_	_",False,"In the sentence, ""coronavirus"" is the direct object of the verb ""gets."" It is introduced by the determiner ""the"" and is part of an adverbial clause marked by ""while."" This clause describes a condition or circumstance under which the main action of hanging out with goats occurs. Specifically, ""coronavirus"" (ID 24) is linked to ""gets"" (ID 22) as its direct object (dobj), indicating that the subject ""everyone else"" is getting the coronavirus.","**Aspect Terms:**
1. **Netflix**: The speaker is willing to bring Netflix to the farm, indicating a positive sentiment towards the streaming service as a source of entertainment.
2. **Farm**: The location where the activity will take place, suggesting a neutral or positive sentiment about spending time in a rural setting.
3. **Goats**: The speaker mentions hanging out with goats, implying a positive or enjoyable aspect of the farm visit.
4. **Coronavirus**: The speaker refers to others getting the coronavirus, which reflects a negative sentiment towards the disease.

Each of these terms is an aspect because the speaker expresses an opinion or attitude towards them, whether positive, negative, or neutral.","The speaker's opinion towards the 'coronavirus' appears to be dismissive or flippant. By suggesting they will hang out with goats while others get the virus, the speaker implies a casual attitude, possibly downplaying the seriousness of the situation.","The sentiment towards coronavirus in the given sentence is negative. Because the speaker suggests a casual and flippant attitude by implying they would rather hang out with goats than take the virus seriously, which indicates a dismissive and negative view of the situation.","The emotion expressed towards 'coronavirus' is primarily dismissive, which aligns most closely with a lack of fear or concern. This attitude doesn't fit neatly into the provided options, but it can be interpreted as a form of anticipation mixed with a hint of disgust. The casual tone and the suggestion of avoiding the virus by hanging out with goats indicates the speaker anticipates the virus spreading, but views this prospect with a mix of indifference and mild revulsion, rather than serious concern."

It is modified by ""China"" (word 1), which is a proper noun (PROPN) and functions as a compound modifier. The phrase ""What we know so far"" (words 4-8) acts as an appositive (appos) to ""coronavirus,"" providing additional information about it. The URLs (words 9-11) are treated as nouns and verbs but do not directly modify ""coronavirus""; they are more likely part of the sentence structure indicating sources or links.","In the given sentence, the primary aspect term is ""coronavirus."" This term is central as it is the topic of the sentence and what the subsequent information (""What we know so far"") pertains to. However, the sentence does not contain explicit opinions on specific aspects like vaccines, lockdowns, or masks. The term ""coronavirus"" itself acts as a broad topic under which various sub-aspects could be discussed, but the sentence primarily serves as an introduction or headline pointing to further detailed content.","The sentence structure does not explicitly convey the speaker's opinion about the coronavirus. Instead, it appears to be a neutral statement, providing a headline or title that introduces a topic and links to sources with more information. The use of ""What we know so far"" suggests an objective, informative approach, indicating that the content is likely to present facts or updates rather than personal opinions.","The sentiment towards coronavirus in the given sentence is neutral. Because the sentence serves as a headline or title that introduces a topic and provides links to sources with more information. It does not express any positive or negative emotions or opinions about the coronavirus; instead, it adopts an objective, informative tone.","The emotion most closely associated with the speaker's tone towards 'coronavirus' in this sentence is trust. The phrase ""What we know so far"" implies a reliable, factual approach, suggesting the information provided can be trusted. There's no indication of emotional bias such as fear, anger, or joy. The tone is neutral and informative, which aligns with trust in the context of presenting facts."
