  "In the sentence \"Meijer store in Michigan, stores are insane right now!!\", the word \"stores\" (ID 6) is a noun (NOUN) and serves as the subject (nsubj) of the clause, with \"are\" (ID 7) being its head. The adjective \"insane\" (ID 8) modifies \"stores\" as an adjectival complement (acomp). The adverbs \"right\" (ID 9) and \"now\" (ID 10) further modify the state described by \"are insane,\" indicating the current time context.",
  "In the provided CoNLL-U format, the term \"coronavirus\" is identified as a proper noun (PROPN) with the lemma \"coronavirus\". It is marked as the root (HEAD 0, DEPREL ROOT) of the third segment of the sentence, indicating it is the main subject or focus of this part. The hashtags before and after \"coronavirus\" (#) are treated as symbols (SYM) and are linked to \"coronavirus\" as compounds, suggesting they modify or specify it. The term \"Covid_19\" is also a proper noun, linked to \"coronavirus\" as an appositive (DEPREL appos), providing an alternative name or clarification. Similarly, \"grocery\" is another appositive to \"coronavirus\", likely used to categorize or contextualize the topic.",
  "In the provided CoNLL-U format, the word \"grocery\" appears in the last segment of the sentence as a noun (NOUN, NN). It is directly connected to the hashtag symbol (#) with the label \"appos,\" indicating it is in apposition to the preceding hashtag \"Covid_19.\" This suggests \"grocery\" is used as a hashtag, likely referring to grocery shopping or supplies, in the context of the coronavirus situation.",
